# Hotel Booking Analysis

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`Hotel_booking__.ipynb`) that performs an exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data cleaning on a hotel booking dataset. The goal of this project is to understand the dataset, preprocess it for further analysis, and lay the groundwork for potential predictive modeling.

## Dataset

This project uses the `hotel_bookings.csv` dataset. This dataset contains booking information for a city hotel and a resort hotel and includes information such as booking date, stay duration, number of adults, children, and babies, and other relevant details. The dataset is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessemosteller/hotel-booking-demand).

## Notebook Overview

 The Jupyter Notebook (`Hotel_booking__.ipynb`) covers the following main steps:

1.  **Data Loading and Initial Inspection:**
    *   Loading the dataset using pandas.
    *   Displaying the first few rows to get a glimpse of the data structure.
    *   Checking data types and identifying non-null values using `info()`.
    *   Analyzing missing values across all columns and calculating their percentages.
    *   Identifying and counting duplicate rows within the dataset.
    *   Determining the overall shape (number of rows and columns) of the DataFrame.

2.  **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:**
    *   **Handling Missing Values:**
        *   Missing values in the `country` column are filled with a placeholder, 'Unknown'.
        *   Missing values in the `agent` column are imputed with -1, indicating no agent information.
        *   The `company` column is dropped entirely due to a very high percentage of missing values, making it unsuitable for reliable imputation or use.
        *   Missing values in `num_children` are filled with 0 and the column is converted to an integer type.
    *   **Column Renaming:** Several columns are renamed for better readability and consistency:
        *   `arrival_date_year` to `year`
        *   `arrival_date_month` to `month`
        *   `arrival_date_day_of_month` to `date`
        *   `adults` to `num_adults`
        *   `children` to `num_children`
        *   `babies` to `num_babies`
    *   **Column Dropping:** The `arrival_date_week_number` column is removed as it was deemed less relevant for the scope of this analysis after initial inspection.
    *   **Data Type Conversion:** The `is_canceled` and `is_repeated_guest` columns are converted to boolean types to represent their true categorical nature more accurately.
    *   **Duplicate Removal:** All duplicate rows are identified and removed from the dataset to ensure data integrity and avoid biased analysis.

## Installation

To run this notebook, you will need Python 3.x and the following libraries:

*   `pandas`
*   `numpy`
*   `matplotlib` (if visualizations are added)
*   `seaborn` (if visualizations are added)

It is recommended to use a virtual environment.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd hotel-booking-analysis

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`

# Install dependencies
pip install pandas numpy
# If you plan to add visualizations
pip install matplotlib seaborn
```

## Usage

1.  Place the `hotel_bookings.csv` file in the same directory as the Jupyter Notebook.
2.  Open the notebook using Jupyter:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
3.  Run all cells in the notebook to perform the data loading, cleaning, and preprocessing steps.

## Key Findings

After the data cleaning and preprocessing steps, the dataset is ready for further analysis. Notable observations from the cleaning phase include:

*   Significant number of duplicate entries were present and successfully removed.
*   Missing values in `country` and `agent` columns were handled appropriately.
*   The `company` column was removed due to excessive missing data.
*   Data types were adjusted for better representation and analysis.

## Future Work

*   Perform in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) with visualizations to uncover patterns and insights.
*   Develop predictive models to forecast hotel booking cancellations or demand.
*   Explore advanced feature engineering techniques.
*   Integrate more data sources or external APIs to enrich the dataset.
